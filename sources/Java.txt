Java is one of many high-level programming languages that use abstraction (reducing and factoring details) to create software for computers and many other electronic devices.  Compared to low-level programming languages, high-level programming languages use a mixture of natural language (any language used by humans) and typical computer terms to create an easier to understand and simpler form of programming.  Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in writing a simple program called “Hello World” in Assembly (a low-level programming language) and in Java.
Like human languages, programming languages have different levels of writing difficulty; some are easy to write, while others require extensive computer knowledge to understand.
There are three parts in a Java program that are essential for a program to run.  In every Java application, the code always starts with a class (where instructions are written) definition.  In the class there is a main method that passes specific requirement into the program.  Finally, other methods other than a main that act as functions are written to do specific tasks that the program requires. Three parts of Java
